# MidJourneyTools
A tampermonkey script that adds functionality to the midjourney.com website to make it easier to do things. 

## Setup Instructions
1. Make sure to install the Tampermonkey plugin in Chrome in order to use this script. 
2. Then create a new script (using tampermonkey)
3. Then copy the ENTIRE contents of "TampermonkeyScriptForMidJourney.js" in this repo and paste it, COMPLETELY all of the text in your new script (yes, all of it) - then press ctrl+s to save.
4. Refresh the MidJourney.com page to ensure the script is activated, if you followed the above steps you will now notice a green bar at the top of the MidJourney.com page. 

## Usage
Once the script is installed, navigate to the MidJourney.com website. You should see a green bar at the top that is titled "MidJourney Tools".
* If you hover over an AI generated image and press 'd' on your keyboard, it will immediatley download it from any page on the site. You can also do this in the "archive" section, however the technique we use for saving there is not as nice as in the "Home" section.
* You can automatically save ALL image on the page by pressing the "Save All" button. This is a toggle, press it again to turn it off. When turned on, the save-all feature will immediately start saving all the images visible on your page. Slowly scroll down to save more. I recommend slowly scrolling down by pressing the middle button on your mouse and letting it scroll slowly (SLOWLY) down until it saves everything. You can save your entire library this way.

Note: Images that have been saved to your computer in the past will be surrounded by a green dotted box. Those images will not automatically save again.

TIP: You can use the web page's filter to only view upscales (or only view grids). I like using the upscales and only download upscales rather than downloading EVERYTHING.
