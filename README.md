# MidJourneyTools
A tampermonkey script that adds functionality to the midjourney.com website to make it easier to do things. 

## Setup Instructions
1. Make sure to install the Tampermonkey plugin in Chrome in order to use this script. 
2. Then create a new script (using tampermonkey)
3. Then copy the contents of "TampermonkeyScriptForMidJourney.js" in this repo and paste it, completely replacing your new script contents - then press ctrl+s to save.
4. Refresh the MidJourney.com page to ensure the script is activated. Find an AI generated image on any page, then press 'd' when hovering your mouse over it to download that image. Doing this in the Home section works better than the Archive section because we're using a better technique for saving currently.
